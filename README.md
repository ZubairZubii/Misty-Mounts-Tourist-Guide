Project Name: Usairam Student Portal

Description:
We are revamping our outdated Student Portal to provide an intuitive, visually appealing, and highly functional interface for students. The new portal must ensure seamless user experience and efficient state management while offering an engaging UI.

Key Features:

Student Dashboard:

Central hub where students can:
Switch between enrolled courses (6-8 courses listed).
View detailed course materials.
Track assignment deadlines.
Monitor progress and overall course completion percentage.
Display personalized statistics such as active assignments, progress, pending deadlines, and recent announcements.
State Management:

Use Zustand for managing state across the application.
Ensure state persists, such as:
Remembering the last visited course or assignment.
Dynamically updating progress and course completion when assignments are marked complete.
Notifications & Announcements:

Announcements should appear with a badge icon on the dashboard and other relevant sections.
Allow students to mark notifications as read while maintaining their context.
Navigation:

Use React Router DOM to handle nested routes effectively.
Ensure smooth transitions between sections (Courses, Overview, Assignments, Progress Tracker, Profile).
Include history tracking and functional "Back" buttons for navigation.
UI/UX:

Prioritize a modern, intuitive, and highly interactive design.
Use icons and visual aids (library of choice) for easy navigation.
Optimize layouts to enhance readability and accessibility.
Data Points to Display:

Student Profile Information: Name, roll number, enrollment status.
Current Course Data: Course progress, recent activity, upcoming deadlines.
Assignments: Details of active and pending assignments.
System-Wide Notifications: Announcements, reminders.
Technical Requirements:

React.js only (no backend).
Zustand for advanced state management.
Handle context persistence across sessions.
Support nested routes and navigation history with React Router DOM.
Include "Back" functionality for seamless navigation.
Design Requirements:

Highly intuitive UI with modern aesthetics.
Icons, images, and badges for better visualization and navigation.
Ensure responsiveness and accessibility across devices.
Use React JS only and also in .jsx format
